I am passionate about User Interface/User Experience Design and Programming. Fluent in Python, JavaScript libraries (ReactJS), HTML5/CSS, UI Prototyping tools (Figma); catching up on multiple others. Presently aiming to pursue a career in the field of Cloud Native Product Development as a Full Stack Engineer (but things change, right?).

I have been a State Level Basketball player and represented my School. I like to spend my leisure time shooting opponents in a video game or creating music (hip-hop beats/lo-fi).
