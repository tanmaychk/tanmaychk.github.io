The CAPM Financial Analysis project is a Python-based implementation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). This model is widely used in finance to estimate the expected return on an investment by taking into account the risk-free rate, the market risk premium, and the asset's beta. The project provides functionalities to calculate the expected returns for a given set of securities based on the CAPM formula.
The application uses libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit and Plotly, to gather stock data from Yahoo Finance and perform calculations to determine expected returns.
