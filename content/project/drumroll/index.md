I created a case study on the UI/UX of the 'Drumroll' app, which is a music preordering service for musicians. The purpose of the case study was to highlight the app's User interface features and perform User Experience research. The study captured the Problem Statement, Business Goals, User Personas & Journey Maps, Lo-fi Wireframes, User Interface Designs and Accessibility considerations.
