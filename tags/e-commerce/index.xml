The site displays a catalogue of products where the user can add or remove items to his/her Shopping Cart. The Cart can be viewed anytime to view the items and subtotal of the cost. Additionally, the Cart can be emptied entirely, or individual items can be removed. On checkout, the address and credit card details are asked for (validation of Card details entered is also done) and when the user proceeds ahead the buying journey is concluded with the message &amp;ldquo;Thank You for Shopping with Us&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
